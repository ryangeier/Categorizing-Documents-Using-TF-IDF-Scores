# Categorizing-Documents-using-TF-IDF-Scores
The goal of this project is to categorize documents into five groups (business, entertainment, politics, sports, or technology). I first computed the TF-IDF scores for each of the documents in the corupus. After those scores were calculated and added to the dataframe, I used both Hierarchial Agglomerative Clustering as well as Divisive Clustering (in this case, k-means) to attempt to use unsupervised learning methods to categorize these documents. 

This project could be taken further with plots, graphs, summary statistics, predictions, as well as a third algorithm for a tie-breaker in an ensemble approach. 

This repository is meant to be a starting point for differnt Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.
